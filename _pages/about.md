<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I'm a student at Duke University studyin data science. 

I was a game data scientist at [Tencent Global Publishing brand Level Infinite](https://www.levelinfinite.com/), providing data-science support to multiple mobile gamaes like [AOV](https://www.arenaofvalor.com/), [Alchemy Stars](https://www.alchemystars.com/), etc. Our primary responsibility involves transforming real-world business challenges into actionable data science problems and providing scientific support to other teams. I love the combination of data science and game-playing, especially from the perspective from machine learning and causal inference. 

I regularly share my thoughts and reflections from my daily job through articles on Medium. If you're interested in these articles and game data science, free free to discuss with me~

My research focuses on the interdisciplinary research in Artificial Intelligence and data science, solving real-world challenges in areas like climate, environment, etc. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging data-science tools to uncover insights and drive decision-making processes in the tech world. 

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

**Augmenting Ground-Level PM2.5 Prediction via Kriging-Based Pseudo-Label Generation**

**Lei Duan**, Ziyang Jiang, David Carlson

<!-- [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong> -->
- We propose a *data-augmentation* strategy to augment the training dataset by introducing unlabeled satellite images paired with pseudo-labels generated through *Ordinary kriging*.

- The articl introduces the Cobb-Douglas production function, adapted to analyze the diminishing impact of increasing key metrics like session count and duration on revenue. This approach underscores the influence of a platform's maturity stage on revenue growth, highlighting the principle of marginal diminishing returns for more effective and rapid revenue modeling.

    - we performed a series of mixed-model linear regressions ("MLM") to understand the relationship between race, poverty, and driver's license suspensions, which allowed us better control for random variation between counties and with better precision estimate the relationship between the predictor variables we care about and outcome variables on North Carolina driver's license suspensions from 2010-2017.

    - Identify the probability of user churn in advance before they churn, and intervene in the game to lower churn rate.
    - cluster users with a high probability of churn in dimensions such as gameplay, social interaction, payment, and depth, and implement differentiated intervention strategies for different types of users to achieve the best user experience and intervention effects.
